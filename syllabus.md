## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course surveys American fiction from the 1980s to the present. It is intended to give you a broad understanding of some issues and styles at play during the period, with an emphasis on prominent authors and literary texts. While the course is not structured around a particular theme or special topic, we will frequently focus on the roles of home, family, and kinship in contemporary American fiction. How is home defined or described? Where is it located? How is the notion of family articulated? How is it experienced and produced through stories? By whom, and from which perspectives? How are kinship networks constructed, and through what sorts of relations? Throughout the term, we’ll witness how these questions surface variously across texts, and we’ll discuss why they appear so important to American fiction since the 1980s.
