## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course surveys American fiction from the 1980s to the present. It is intended to give you a broad understanding of some issues and styles at play during the period, with an emphasis on prominent authors and literary texts. While the course is not structured around a particular theme or special topic, we will focus frequently on the roles of home, family, and kinship in contemporary American fiction. How is home defined or described? Where is it located? How are families produced and experienced through stories? By whom, and from which perspectives? How are kinship networks constructed, and how do people relate within them? Throughout the term, we’ll see these questions surfacing variously across texts, and we’ll discuss why they appear so important to American fiction since the 1980s.

## OBJECTIVES 
By the conclusion of this course, you should: 
* Purposefully read and analyze contemporary American fiction (1980s to the present) by attending to the following six dimensions of literature: narrative, power, language, ethics, history, and reception,    
* Identify key passages, terms, and themes from a selection of contemporary American novels and short stories, 
* Concisely communicate the relevance of social, cultural, and aesthetic issues common to contemporary American fiction, with an emphasis on issues of home, family, and kinship, 
* Demonstrate an awareness of several strategies and genres writers use to interpret contemporary American fiction, including techniques invested in analysis, context, and creativity, and 
* Conduct writing workshops with your peers by circulating drafts of your work, commenting on work by others, and revising your drafts before submitting them for assessment.  

These objectives will be evaluated through three writing assignments, two writing workshops, and a final exam.

## ASSESSMENT
The Department of English uses the following scale for grading purposes: 
* A+: 90-100		
* A: 85-89				
* A-:80-84				
* B+: 77-79			
* B: 73-76	
* B-: 70-72
* C+: 65-69
* C: 60-64
* D: 50-59
* F: 0-49

I do not use plagiarism detection software when assessing student work, and final grades will be determined in accordance with the University’s official grading system.

### N Grades
Students who submit the following will complete the course and will be assigned a final grade: 
* One writing assignment, and   
* The final exam.

Failure to complete these will result in an "N" regardless of the cumulative percentage on other assignments. An "N" is a failing grade, and it factors into your GPA as a 0 (the maximum percentage that can accompany an "N" on a transcript is 49).  

### Grading Rubric for All Writing Assignments  
* A+: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is incredibly focused and coherently integrates material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is incredibly persuasive. Overall, the response to the assignment is exceptional for undergraduate work.
* A- through A: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is persuasive. Overall, the response to the assignment is far above average for undergraduate work. 
* B- through B+: The content meets expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates some awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is sound. Overall, the response to the assignment is average or just above average for undergraduate work. 
* C or C+: The content meets some expectations of the prompt. It is somewhat focused and integrates some material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates minimal awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers few perspectives. It reflects engagement with the selected text(s); however, the argument/composition is not sound. Overall, the response to the assignment is average or just below average for undergraduate work.
* D: The content does not meet expectations of the prompt. It is not focused, or it does not integrate material from the selected text(s). It does not demonstrate awareness of its own limitations or implications, or it does not consider multiple perspectives. It does not reflect engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is not sound. Overall, the response to the assignment is below average.  
* F: The content is missing or falls extremely short of the word count.

(Aspects of this grading rubric were borrowed from a syllabus by Mark Sample.)

### Grading Rubric for Writing Workshops

* A+: The circulated material and feedback exceed expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate active and thorough participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers and a nuanced understanding of the revision process. Overall, the participation is exceptional at the undergraduate level.  
* A- through A: The circulated material and feedback exceed expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate active and thorough participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers. Overall, the participation is far above average at the undergraduate level.  
* B- through B+: The circulated material and feedback meet expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate active participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers. Overall, the participation is average or just above average at the undergraduate level.  
* C or C+: The circulated material and feedback meet some expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers. Overall, the participation is just below average at the undergraduate level.  
* D: The circulated material and feedback meet few or no expectations of the prompt. Overall, the participation is below average at the undergraduate level.  
* F: No participation in the workshop.  

### How to Do Well in this Course 
* *Read the books before we discuss them.* Otherwise, you will not be able to follow lectures or conversations in class. Plus, demonstrating you’ve read the book means you’ll likely do well on the final exam.
* *Write while you read.* For me this means annotating a text as I read it. You can annotate print and digital texts. (See me if you need ideas or resources.)
* *Come to class with ideas and questions.* Be curious. Seek connections not only between texts but also between this course and other courses you’re taking.
* *Take notes during class meetings.* A good portion of the final exam will cover what we talk about in class. Students who take notes not only understand but also retain the material better. 
* *Let me know when you don't follow what I'm saying.* I find this stuff fascinating, but I will not always know what you want to investigate or learn more about. If you have questions, then please don't hesitate to ask them. I do not want anyone to feel like an imposter in this course.
* *Persuasive writing takes time.* Before you submit an assignment, consider circulating drafts. Ask friends or peers to give your writing a gander. Come chat with me during office hours. Consider how your writing can extend and even complicate our class discussions. Also, avoid writing that is primarily descriptive. Push your work into an analysis of the assumptions and ambiguities at work in literature.
* *During class and in writing, be concrete when you comment on anyone's work* (including the fiction we're discussing). Quote it. Speak to specific gestures. And then respond with your own interpretations. When the work is by a peer, affirm their ideas (e.g., “I like how you…”).
* *Use class meetings to share ideas, but also discuss what we’re reading outside of class.* If you have a question, then ask me or your classmates. If you hear something you want to remember, then write it down for reference later. If you feel like we’re ignoring something important in class, then bring it to our attention. Consider forming reading and writing groups for the course.

## POLICIES 

### Attendance 
You are expected to attend all classes in which you are enrolled. A department may require a student to withdraw from a course if the student is registered in another course that conflicts with it in time. An instructor may refuse a student admission to a lecture because of lateness, misconduct, inattention, or failure to meet the responsibilities of the course. Students who neglect their academic work, including assignments, may be refused permission to write the final examination in a course. Students who are absent because of illness, an accident, or family affliction should report to me upon their return to classes.

Aside from attending for the sake of attending, I create several incentives for you to come to class. Those incentives include: 1) lectures and discussion related to your assignments and exam, 2) mentioning material that will be on the exam, 3) clarification of key terms as well as aspects of the texts we’re reading, 4) writing workshops intended to help you revise and improve you work, and 5) encouraging you to speak with others about literature—and that’s fun, too!  

If you miss more than 20% of the scheduled class meetings (without documentation of illness, accident, or family affliction), then you may not qualify for the final exam.

### Circulation of Marks 
I will not—at any time—post your marks outside my office door, online, or in any other public forum. 

### Participation 
Since conversations are essential to the quality of this class, we will work together to create an atmosphere premised on difference. University level discourse does not shy away from sensitive issues, including questions of race, gender, class, sexuality, politics, ability, and religion, and neither will we. There are going to be differences in opinions, beliefs, and interpretations when we read literature, question it, and engage history and culture. You need not agree with the arguments presented during class or with what your peers or I have to say—in fact, it is important to think critically and question course material. But please do so intelligently, without the assumption that everyone agrees with you or shares your experiences. Difference is central to creating a classroom in which a variety of ideas can be exchanged and points of view can be explored. Ultimately, what is crucial to this course is that you are comfortable expressing yourself and your ideas. If, for whatever reason, you are not, then you should notify me immediately by email or visit me during my office hours. I understand that some people are more comfortable speaking in front of the class than others. That said, participation in office hours also augments learning. If you are not comfortable bringing your concerns directly to me or are not satisfied with my response to your inquiries, then I encourage you to contact the Department of English.

### Late and Missed Submissions 
If writing assignments are submitted after the due date, then I will not comment on them. Extension of a due date must be negotiated with me in advance, and medical or other emergency exceptions to this policy must be properly documented. 

### Mobile Technologies in the Classroom
I do not ban laptops or other mobile technologies in the classroom. Feel free to use them for note-taking, in-class research, or other class-related activities.  

### E-Mail 
With the exception of holidays and weekends, I will respond to your emails within twenty-four hours.

### Learning Climate
The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the UVic human rights policy. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to adhere to the UVic academic integrity policy. Violations of this policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review.

### Writing Improvement
I may require you to seek general writing improvement and/or tutoring at The Learning and Teaching Centre. If so, then I may also ask you to revise your work within three weeks of receiving notice from me. 

### Accessibility 
Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, then please feel free to approach me and/or the Resource Centre for Students with a Disability (RCSD) as soon as possible. RCSD staff is available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the sooner we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE TERRITORIES 
The Department of English respectfully acknowledges that the University of Victoria is situated on the territory of the Coast and Straits Salish peoples and sits on the site of a former Lkwungen village. We acknowledge and respect the Lekwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the university resides and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationship with the land continues to this day.
