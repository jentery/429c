## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course surveys American fiction from the 1980s to the present. It is intended to give you a broad understanding of some issues and styles at play during the period, with an emphasis on prominent authors and literary texts. While the course is not structured around a particular theme or special topic, we will focus frequently on the roles of home, family, and kinship in contemporary American fiction. How is home defined or described? Where is it located? How are families produced and experienced through stories? By whom, and from which perspectives? How are kinship networks constructed, and how do people relate within them? Throughout the term, we’ll see these questions surfacing variously across texts, and we’ll discuss why they appear so important to American fiction since the 1980s.

## OBJECTIVES 
By the conclusion of this course, you should: 
* Purposefully read and analyze contemporary American fiction (1980s to the present) by attending to the following six dimensions of literature: narrative, power, language, ethics, history, and reception,    
* Identify key passages, terms, and themes from a selection of contemporary American novels and short stories, 
* Concisely communicate the relevance of social, cultural, and aesthetic issues common to contemporary American fiction, with an emphasis on issues of home, family, and kinship, 
* Demonstrate an awareness of several strategies and genres writers use to interpret contemporary American fiction, including techniques invested in analysis, context, and creativity, and 
* Conduct writing workshops with your peers by circulating drafts of your work, commenting on work by others, and revising your drafts before submitting them for assessment.  

These objectives will be evaluated through three writing assignments, two writing workshops, and a final exam.

## ASSESSMENT
The Department of English uses the following scale for grading purposes: 
* A+: 90-100		
* A: 85-89				
* A-:80-84				
* B+: 77-79			
* B: 73-76	
* B-: 70-72
* C+: 65-69
* C: 60-64
* D: 50-59
* F: 0-49

I do not use plagiarism detection software when assessing student work, and final grades will be determined in accordance with the University’s official grading system.

### N Grades
Students who submit the following will complete the course and will be assigned a final grade: 
* One writing assignment, and   
* The final exam.

Failure to complete these will result in an "N" regardless of the cumulative percentage on other assignments. An "N" is a failing grade, and it factors into your GPA as a 0 (the maximum percentage that can accompany an "N" on a transcript is 49).  

### Grading Rubric for All Writing Assignments  
* A+: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is incredibly focused and coherently integrates material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is incredibly persuasive. Overall, the response to the assignment is exceptional for undergraduate work.
* A- through A: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is persuasive. Overall, the response to the assignment is far above average for undergraduate work. 
* B- through B+: The content meets expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates some awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is sound. Overall, the response to the assignment is average or just above average for undergraduate work. 
* C or C+: The content meets some expectations of the prompt. It is somewhat focused and integrates some material from the selected text(s). It demonstrates minimal awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers few perspectives. It reflects engagement with the selected text(s); however, the argument/composition is not sound. Overall, the response to the assignment is average or just below average for undergraduate work.
* D: The content does not meet expectations of the prompt. It is not focused, or it does not integrate material from the selected text(s). It does not demonstrate awareness of its own limitations or implications, or it does not consider multiple perspectives. It does not reflect engagement with the selected text(s), and the argument/composition is not sound. Overall, the response to the assignment is below average.  
* F: The content is missing or falls extremely short of the word count.

(Aspects of this grading rubric were borrowed from a syllabus by Mark Sample.)

### Grading Rubric for Writing Workshops

* A+: The circulated material and feedback exceed expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate active and thorough participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers and a nuanced understanding of the revision process. Overall, the participation is exceptional at the undergraduate level.  
* A- through A: The circulated material and feedback exceed expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate active and thorough participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers. Overall, the participation is far above average at the undergraduate level.  
* B- through B+: The circulated material and feedback meet expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate active participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers. Overall, the participation is average or just above average at the undergraduate level.  
* C or C+: The circulated material and feedback meet some expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate participation in the workshop as well as a respect for work by peers. Overall, the participation is just below average at the undergraduate level.  
* D: The circulated material and feedback meet few or no expectations of the prompt. Overall, the participation is below average at the undergraduate level.  
* F: No participation in the workshop.  

### How to Do Well in this Course 
* *Read the books before we discuss them.* Otherwise, you will not be able to follow lectures or conversations in class. Plus, demonstrating you’ve read the book means you’ll likely do well on the final exam.
* *Write while you read.* For me this means annotating a text as I read it. You can annotate print and digital texts. (See me if you need ideas or resources.)
* *Come to class with ideas and questions.* Be curious. Seek connections not only between texts but also between this course and other courses you’re taking.
* *Take notes during class meetings.* A good portion of the final exam will cover what we talk about in class. Students who take notes not only understand but also retain the material better. 
* *Let me know when you don't follow what I'm saying.* I find this stuff fascinating, but I will not always know what you want to investigate or learn more about. If you have questions, then please don't hesitate to ask them. I do not want anyone to feel like an imposter in this course.
* *Persuasive writing takes time.* Before you submit an assignment, consider circulating drafts. Ask friends or peers to give your writing a gander. Come chat with me during office hours. Consider how your writing can extend and even complicate our class discussions. Also, avoid writing that is primarily descriptive. Push your work into an analysis of the assumptions and ambiguities at work in literature.
* *During class and in writing, be concrete when you comment on anyone's work* (including the fiction we're discussing). Quote it. Speak to specific gestures. And then respond with your own interpretations. When the work is by a peer, affirm their ideas (e.g., “I like how you…”).
* *Use class meetings to share ideas, but also discuss what we’re reading outside of class.* If you have a question, then ask me or your classmates. If you hear something you want to remember, then write it down for reference later. If you feel like we’re ignoring something important in class, then bring it to our attention. Consider forming reading and writing groups for the course.
