This course surveys American fiction from the 1980s to the present. It is intended to give you a broad understanding of some issues and styles at play during the period, with an emphasis on prominent authors and literary texts. While the course is not structured around a particular theme or special topic, we will often focus on the roles of home, family, and kinship in contemporary American fiction. How is home defined or described? Where is it located? How are families produced and experienced through stories? By whom, and from which perspectives? How are kinship networks constructed, and how do people relate within them? Throughout the term, we'll see how these questions surface variously across texts, and we'll discuss why they appear so important to American fiction from the 1980s forward.
