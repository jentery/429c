This writing assignment emphasizes the contexts that influence or shape the interpretation of contemporary fiction. It requires some reading beyond the texts at hand. For it, you have three options. Please choose one.  

1) **Intended Audience and Reception**: Who is the text's intended audience, and how was the text received across venues?  

In ~750 words (MLA format), assess an assigned text’s reception and also identify and describe its intended audience(s). As you write, consider the details that matter for audience and reception: date of publication, publisher, awards, and the author’s publication history. Also consider the various venues for reception: everything from the CBC and *New York Times* to Amazon and Goodreads to journal articles in the MLA International Bibliography. When identifying intended audiences, please be as specific as possible.  

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* When was the book published? By whom? 
* Who did the original cover art? What was on the cover? 
* Was it the author’s first book? Last book? Somewhere in between? How similar is it to the author’s other books? 
* What awards did the book receive? 
* How many editions now exist? 
* Where was the book reviewed? Who reviewed it? Were the reviews positive? What did they focus on? What role did the author’s reputation play in the reviews? 
* How did reviews differ from one venue to the next? What do you make of these differences? 
* How is the book rated by social cataloguing and commerce sites? What sort of comments do people leave about it? 
* Is there any tension between "popular" reception and "critical" reception? If so, then why? 
* How much scholarship has been written about the book? 
* Where is the book popular? Who tends to identify with it? 
* Does the book have a fan culture or subculture? 
* How would you describe the book’s intended audience? Why does this audience matter when reviewing the book? 
* Did the book become something else, such as a movie or play? How well was the adaptation received? To what effects on interpretation?   

If you choose this option, then feel free to assess the overall reception of an assigned text, with details drawn from a range of reviews, comments, and publications (both popular and academic) and attention given to the particulars of its intended audience(s). Since you’re assessing the reception of a text and describing its intended audience, you don't need to make an academic argument. Feel free to write for a broad, non-expert audience. (This is not a close reading assignment.) However, your assessment and description should be precise, drawing upon at least ten different sources across news outlets (such as newspapers and radio), social media, and academic journals.   

2) **Geographic Location**: What is the geographic setting of the text, and why is that setting significant? 

In ~750 words (MLA format), describe one geographic setting of an assigned text and explain why that setting is significant. Of note, this geographic setting should be an actual place that exists or once existed on Earth. As you write, consider the details that matter for the geography of fiction: names of countries and states/provinces, demographics, capital cities, urban and rural locations, histories of place, climate, landscape, (official) language(s), native and settler groups, and population numbers. To acquire this information, you may want to consult a variety of sources, including academic, official, and government publications as well as records such as census data. While you may refer to passages in your assigned text, the emphasis of this assignment should be on the particulars of an actual, geographic setting and its significance. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* Where does the text take place? 
* Where do characters say they are from? Where are they going? Where do they feel like they belong? 
* What language(s) do characters speak? How is langauge tied to location? 
* How does the text describe its settings? From whose perspective(s)? 
* What values does the text associate with the land? With rural areas? With urban areas? 
* How is history tied to people and places in the text? 
* How is nature described? 
* When you talk about settings in the text, how specific can you get? Country? City? Neighbourhood? Street? Building? Why does this specificity matter? 
* How do questions of geography correspond with the aesthetics or politics of the text? What social or cultures issues does geography help the text address? 
* Have you been to the places referenced in the text? To what effects on interpretation?   

If you choose this option, then feel free to describe one particular geographic setting in the text, with details and data drawn from a range of venues and publications. Since you're describing the setting of a text and explaining its significance, you don't need to make an academic argument. Feel free to write for a broad, non-expert audience. When you address the significance of the geographic setting, you can focus on the particulars of that setting instead of passages from your selected text. (This is not a close reading assignment.) However, your description of a geographic setting should be precise, drawing upon at least five different reliable sources.
