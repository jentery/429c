This writing assignment focuses on the contexts that shape interpretation. It requires some reading beyond the texts at hand. For it, you have three options. Please choose one. 

1) **Intended Audience and Reception**: Who is the text's intended audience, and how was the text received across venues?  

In ~750 words (MLA format), assess an assigned text’s reception and also identify and describe its intended audience(s). As you write, consider the details that matter for audience and reception: date of publication, publisher, awards, and the author’s publication history. Also consider various venues for reception: everything from the CBC and *New York Times* to Amazon and Goodreads to journal articles in the MLA International Bibliography. When identifying intended audiences, please be as specific as possible.  

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* When was the book published? By whom? 
* Who did the original cover art? What was on the cover? 
* Was it the author’s first book? Last book? Somewhere in between? How similar is it to the author’s other books? 
* What awards did the book receive? 
* How many editions now exist? 
* Where was the book reviewed? Who reviewed it? Were the reviews positive? What did they focus on? What role did the author’s reputation play in the reviews? 
* How did reviews differ from one venue to the next? What do you make of these differences? 
* How is the book rated by social cataloguing and commerce sites? What sort of comments do people leave about it? 
* Is there any tension between "popular" reception and "critical" reception? If so, then why? 
* How much scholarship has been written about the book? 
* Where is the book popular? Who tends to identify with it? 
* Does the book have a fan culture or subculture? 
* How would you describe the book’s intended audience? Why does this audience matter when reviewing the book? 
* Did the book become something else, such as a movie or play? How well was the adaptation received? To what effects on interpretation?   

If you choose this option, then feel free to assess the overall reception of an assigned text, with details drawn from a range of reviews, comments, and publications (both popular and academic) and attention given to the particulars of its intended audience(s). Since you’re assessing the reception of a text and describing its intended audience, you don't need to make an academic argument. Feel free to write for a broad, non-expert audience. (This is not a close reading assignment.) However, your assessment and description should be precise, drawing upon at least ten different sources across news outlets (such as newspapers and radio), social media, and academic journals.   

2) **Geographic Location**: What is the geographic setting of the text, and why is that setting significant? 

In ~750 words (MLA format), describe one geographic setting of an assigned text and explain why that setting is significant. Of note, this geographic setting should be an actual place that exists or once existed on Earth. As you write, consider the details that matter for the geography of fiction: names of countries and states/provinces, demographics, capital cities, urban and rural locations, histories of place, climate, landscape, (official) language(s), native and settler groups, and population numbers. To acquire this information, you may want to consult a variety of sources, including academic, official, and government publications as well as records such as census data. While you may refer to passages in your assigned text, the emphasis of this assignment should be on the particulars of an actual, geographic setting and its significance for the text. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* Where does the text take place? 
* Where do characters say they are from? Where are they going? Where do they feel like they belong? 
* What language(s) do characters speak? How is langauge tied to location? 
* How does the text describe its settings? From whose perspective(s)? 
* What values does the text associate with land? With rural areas? With urban areas? 
* How is history tied to people and places in the text? 
* How is nature described? How is culture described? Where are they located? 
* When you talk about settings in the text, how specific can you get? Country? City? Neighbourhood? Street? Building? Why does this specificity matter? 
* How do questions of geography correspond with the aesthetics or politics of the text? What social or cultural issues does geography address? 
* Have you been to places referenced in the text? To what effects on interpretation?   

If you choose this option, then feel free to describe one particular geographic setting in the text, with details and data drawn from a range of venues and publications. Since you're describing the setting of a text and explaining its significance, you don't need to make an academic argument. Feel free to write for a broad, non-expert audience. When you address the significance of the geographic setting, you can focus on the particulars of that setting instead of passages from your selected text. (This is not a close reading assignment.) However, your description of a geographic setting should be precise, drawing upon at least five different reliable sources.   

3) **A Past Event**: When is a historical event mentioned in the text, and why is that event significant? 

In ~750 words (MLA format), describe one past/historical event mentioned in an assigned text and explain why that event is significant. Of note, this event should be an actual event that occurred on Earth. As you write, consider the details that matter for histories of events: names, participants, dates, locations, descriptions, documentation, controversies, memories, and days of remembrance. To acquire this information, you may want to consult a variety of sources, including academic, official, and government publications as well as historical records. While you may refer to passages in your assigned text, the emphasis of this assignment should be on the particulars of an actual, historical event and its significance for the text. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* What are the histories and events upon which your selected text relies? 
* To which documents or records do characters refer? 
* What events are remembered or mentioned often in the text? 
* How is the event coded? With what or whom is it associated? 
* Which historical events do the characters attend or participate in? Which events do they study or research? 
* Which events haunt the text or its characters? 
* Which events are represented, revised, or illustrated by the text? 
* When does the text read more like non-fiction than fiction? Which historical events are used as material for that non-fiction? 
* Which events do we assume actually happened? Which events appear fabricated? 
* When do you trust the text's account of history or reality? When don't you? Why? 
* How do you draw boundaries between fiction and history? To what effects on interpretation?   

If you choose this option, then feel free to describe one historical event mentioned in the text, with details and data drawn from a range of venues and publications. Since you're describing an event and explaining its significance, you don't need to make an academic argument. Feel free to write for a broad, non-expert audience. When you address the significance of the event, you can focus on the particulars of that event instead of passages from your selected text. (This is not a close reading assignment.) However, your description of an event should be precise, drawing upon at least five different reliable sources.
