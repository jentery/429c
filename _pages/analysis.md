This writing assignment emphasizes close reading, without much (if any) need to read beyond the novel or short story at hand. For it, you have three choices: 

1) **Narrative**: What is significant about the text’s narrative? 

Write an academic argument in ~1000 words (MLA format) about how the narrative of an assigned text is constructed and why its construction is compelling or unique. As you write, consider describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but also interpreting one or two key passages in detail. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* What is the form of the text? How are pieces of the story stitched together? 
* How is time structured? Is it chronological? Non-linear? 
* How does the text flash back or flash forward? 
* How does it use footnotes, if at all? 
* How is it focalized? Who presents the story? What do they remember, know, ignore, or forget? How do they travel from place to place or moment to moment? 
* Are there ghosts? If so, then how do they correspond with the present?  
* While reading, what must we assume or suspend? 
* Does the narrative have a beginning, middle, and end? If so, then where are they? If not, then why? 
* Is there resolution on the last page? To what effects on interpretation? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write about the overall form of the text as well as a specific instance or two where its narrative structure influences the ways in which readers understand how the story unfolds.  

2) **Power**: What is significant about how power operates in the text? 

Write an academic argument in ~1000 words (MLA format) about how power operates within an assigned text and why this approach to power is compelling or unique. As you write, consider describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but also interpreting one or two key passages in detail. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* Who has agency or mobility in the text? In what situations? In relations with whom? 
* How do racism, patriarchy, colonialism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia, classism, and/or sexism operate in the text? 
* What do characters assume about each other? 
* What social positions are treated as the default or norm? 
* Who gets to speak, to whom, and when?
* Who is considered an expert, and under what assumptions? 
* How do characters switch codes or morph their behaviours across situations? How do they identify? 
* Who is the text’s intended audience, and how does the text speak to them? To what effects on interpretation? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write about power dynamics or power structures in the text and then anchor them in a specific instance or two where the text's accounts of power influence how readers understand the ways in which social issues/relations unfold.
