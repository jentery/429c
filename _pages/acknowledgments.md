The Department of English respectfully acknowledges that the University of Victoria is situated on the territory of the Coast and Straits Salish peoples and sits on the site of a former Lkwungen village. We acknowledge and respect the Lekwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the university resides and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationship with the land continues to this day.
