This writing assignment emphasizes creative integrations of fiction into your everyday life. It requires some thinking and practice beyond the essay format. For it, you have three options. Please choose one. 

1) **Mimicry**: What do we learn from mimicking the texts we read? 

Please identify an event or everyday occurrence from this term (e.g., something that happened to you or something you do routinely) and write ~500 words about it in the style or voice of an assigned text. Please also write ~300 words reflecting on what you learned about the text (in particular) and fiction (in general) from this act of mimicry.  

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* How would you describe the style or voice of the text at hand? Where possible, pick precise adjectives to describe it.  
* If the text had a personality, then what would it be? 
* Which passages do you find most compelling? Why? 
* How long are the sentences? The paragraphs? 
* What kind of vocabulary is used? 
* How is dialogue written or expressed? 
* What tense is most common? 
* What types of figurative language are preferred?
* Do you notice any unique punctuation? 
* Does the writing tend to "record" or "capture" what happened, or does it project its own world? 
* When does the text make you laugh? Why? 
* When does the text make you cry? Why? 
* When can't you put the text down? When do you put it down? Why? 
* What subject positions and perspectives are represented? 
* How is the text narrated? 
* How does it sound when you read it aloud? 
* With which assigned text do you most identify? Least identify? To what degree is identification tied to mimicry? 
* How can you mimic the writing sincerely, without irony or parody? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write a short, creative piece of mimicry based on your own, recent experiences, together with a reflection on what you learned from the process. Of course, the reflection may be informal, written in the first person, and steeped in your own perceptions of the writing experience and your own relation to the selected text. The style of a compelling act of mimicry should be difficult to discern from the style of the original text; however, the content should anchored in your everyday life. If you are working with a graphic novel, then you are more than welcome to illustrate a page or two instead of writing ~500 words.
