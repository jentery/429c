This writing assignment emphasizes creative integrations of fiction into your everyday life. It requires some thinking and practice beyond the essay format. For it, you have three options. Please choose one. 

1) **Mimicry**: What do we learn from mimicking the texts we read? 

Please identify an event or everyday occurrence from this term (e.g., something that just happened to you or something you do routinely) and write ~500 words about it in the style or voice of an assigned text. Please also write ~300 words reflecting on what you learned about the text (in particular) and fiction (in general) from this act of mimicry.  

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* How would you describe the style or voice of the text you're about to mimic? Where possible, pick precise adjectives to describe it.  
* If the text had a personality, then what would it be? 
* Which passages do you find most compelling? Why? 
* How long are the sentences? The paragraphs? 
* When is the text specific or detailed? When is it vague? Why? 
* What kind of vocabulary is used? 
* How is dialogue written or expressed? 
* What tense is most common? 
* What types of figurative language are preferred?
* Do you notice any unique punctuation? 
* Does the writing tend to "record" or "capture" what happened, or does it project its own world? 
* When does the text make you laugh? Why? 
* When does the text make you cry? Why? 
* When does the text bore you? Why? 
* When can't you put the text down? When do you put it down? Why? 
* What subject positions and perspectives are represented by the text? 
* How is the text narrated? 
* How does it sound when you read it aloud? 
* With which assigned text do you most identify? Least identify? To what degree is identification tied to mimicry? 
* How can you mimic the writing sincerely, without irony or parody? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write a short, creative piece of mimicry based on your own, recent experiences, together with a reflection on what you learned from the process. Of course, the reflection may be informal, written in the first person, and steeped in your own perceptions of the writing experience and your own relation to the selected text. However, it should be precise and anchored in detail, and it should demonstrate some self-awareness of the decisions you made and their effects. The style of a compelling act of mimicry should be difficult to discern from the style of the original text, but the content should based in (or represent) your everyday life. If you are working with a graphic novel, then you are more than welcome to illustrate a page or two instead of writing ~500 words.   

2) **Podcast**: What do we learn from talking about texts with an audience? 

Please identify an assigned text and create a three- to four-minute podcast episode that reviews the text for a specific audience. The episode should be composed with a particular podcast (that already exists) in mind, and you should identify the podcast and provide its URL in writing. The podcast should be accompanied by a script or transcript consisting of at least 450 words.

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* What are some podcasts you enjoy? Why do you listen to them? How do they engage literature and culture? If you were to write an episode for them, then what would it sound like? What sort of content would be appropriate? 
* How does talking about a book differ from writing about it? How does your style, delivery, and audience change across modes? 
* What makes a good book review? When do you consult them? Why do others consult them? Why listen to one instead of reading it? 
* Would you recommend your selected text to others? Why or why not? 
* In a review, how do you balance attention to the particulars of a text with your general impressions of it? 
* Who is the intended audience for your podcast? What would they expect from a review? Where and how would they listen to you? With headphones? In a car? At home?
* If you read a passage from your text aloud, then what does it sound like? Will you read passages aloud in your podcast? 
* Have you heard the author of your text read aloud? If so, then what do they sound like? How could you include their voice in your podcast? 
* What other sounds may accompany your voice and review? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to compose a two- to four-minute review of your selected text and submit it via removable media or a URL in MP3 or WAV format. I will assess your podcast for its content, not its production. Please do not spend time on the particulars of either recording (including acoustics) or post-production (including editing and effects). Focus on content. You should submit your WAV or MP3 file with either a script written prior to the podcast (recommended) or a transcript produced from it. For radio and podcasts, 150-words-per-minute is the average. With your script or transcript, please provide the title and URL for the podcast you have in mind. I will be sure to listen to the podcast before I listen to the episode you've composed for it.  

3) **Quiz**: What do we learn from designing quizzes about fiction? 

Please identify an assigned text and create a quiz for it. You are free to select any type of quiz here, from one intended for a school setting (as if you're teaching the assigned text) to a personality or trivia quiz (to share online or among friends). Your quiz should contain at least ten questions, and you should have at least two people take it before you submit it to me. As you compose the quiz, I recommend making a spreadsheet for your questions, answers, and results. Please also write ~300 words reflecting on what you learned about your selected text (in particular) and fiction (in general) from this exercise in quiz design. Your reflection should account for the process of not only writing the quiz but also interpreting the answers you received. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* What sort of quiz do you like to take? Not like to take? Why? 
* If you were teaching your selected text, then how would you quiz your students? What would you like them to demonstrate? Under what assumptions? 
* What types of questions should your quiz ask? Multiple choice? Short answer? Fill-in-the-blank? Identification? A mix? What's your rationale here? 
* How should you weigh and score the answers? 
* How should people complete your quiz? On paper? Via a screen? Would they want to share their results? 
* Who is your intended audience? Students? Fans? Scholars? 
* What is the aim of your quiz? Fun? Education? Trivia? In literary studies, how do we draw the boundaries between fandom and scholarship?
* What kind of quiz seems appropriate for your selected text? How should you turn material from the text into material for a quiz? For instance, how do characters become personalities or passages become trivia? How does "what you read" become "what you should know"? 
* What is the relationship between quizzes and games? How do both intersect with fiction? 
* How might you experiment with the quiz as a form? How might the author of your selected text design a quiz? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to design a quiz with at least ten questions, together with a reflection consisting of ~300 words. You can design the quiz on paper or with software. Either way, I will take the quiz while assessing it and your reflection. Just make sure I can access the correct answers in some fashion. Of course, the reflection may be informal, written in the first person, and steeped in your own perceptions of the design experience and your own relation to the selected text. However, the reflection should still be precise and anchored in detail, and it should demonstrate some self-awareness of the decisions you made and their effects.
