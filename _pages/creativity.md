This writing assignment emphasizes creative integrations of fiction into your everyday life. It requires some thinking and practice beyond the essay format. For it, you have three options. Please choose one. 

1) **Mimicry**: What do we learn from mimicking the texts we read? 

Please identify an event or everyday occurrence from this term (e.g., something that happened to you or something you do routinely) and write ~500 words about it in the style or voice of an assigned text. Please also write ~300 words reflecting on what you learned about the text (in particular) and fiction (in general) from this act of mimicry.  

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* How would you describe the style or voice of the text at hand? Where possible, pick precise adjectives to describe it.  
* If the text had a personality, then what would it be? 
* Which passages do you find most compelling? Why? 
* How long are the sentences? The paragraphs? 
* What kind of vocabulary is used? 
* How is dialogue written or expressed? 
* What tense is most common? 
* What types of figurative language are preferred?
* Do you notice any unique punctuation? 
* Does the writing tend to "record" or "capture" what happened, or does it project its own world? 
* When does the text make you laugh? Why? 
* When does the text make you cry? Why? 
* When can't you put the text down? When do you put it down? Why? 
* What subject positions and perspectives are represented? 
* How is the text narrated? 
* How does it sound when you read it aloud? 
* With which assigned text do you most identify? Least identify? To what degree is identification tied to mimicry? 
* How can you mimic the writing sincerely, without irony or parody? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write a short, creative piece of mimicry based on your own, recent experiences, together with a reflection on what you learned from the process. Of course, the reflection may be informal, written in the first person, and steeped in your own perceptions of the writing experience and your own relation to the selected text. The style of a compelling act of mimicry should be difficult to discern from the style of the original text; however, the content should anchored in your everyday life. If you are working with a graphic novel, then you are more than welcome to illustrate a page or two instead of writing ~500 words. 

2) **Podcast**: What do we learn from talking about texts with an audience? 

Please identify an assigned text and create a three- to four-minute podcast episode that reviews the text for a specific audience. The episode should be composed with a particular podcast (that already exists) in mind, and you should identify the podcast and provide its URL in writing. The podcast should be accompanied by a script or transcription consisting of at least 450 words.

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* What are some podcasts you enjoy? Why do you listen to them? How do they engage literature and culture? If you were to write an episode for them, then what would it sound like? What sort of content would be appropriate? 
* How does talking about a book differ from writing about it? How does your style, delivery, and audience change across modes? 
* What makes a good book review? When do you consult them? Why do others consult them? Why listen to one instead of reading it? 
* Would you recommend your selected text to others? Why or why not? 
* In a review, how do you balance attention to the particulars of a text with your general impressions of it? 
* Who is the intended audience for your podcast? What would they expect from a review? Where and how would they listen to you? With headphones? In a car? At home?
* If you read a passage from your text aloud, then what does it sound like? Will you read passages aloud in your podcast? 
* Have you heard the author of your text read aloud? If so, then what do they sound like? How could you include their voice in your podcast? 
* What other sounds may accompany your voice and review? 

If you choose to this option, then feel free to compose a two- to four-minute review of your selected text and submit it via removable media or a URL in MP3 or WAV format. I will assess your podcast for its content, not its production. Please do not spend time on the particulars of either recording (including acoustics) or post-production (including editing and effects). You should submit your WAV or MP3 file with either a script written prior to the podcast (recommended) or a transcription produced from it. For radio and podcasts, 150-words-per-minute is the average. With your script or transcription, please provide the title and URL for the podcast you have in mind for your episode. I will be sure to listen to the podcast before I listen to the episode you've composed for it.
